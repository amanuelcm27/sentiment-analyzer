# Sentiment Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Sentiment Analysis** deep learning model trained to classify text as **positive** or **negative** sentiment. The model (`sentiment_modelv1.1.keras`) was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved **81.56% accuracy** on the test set.

This model can be integrated into real-world systems where understanding customer sentiment is valuable, such as:
- **E-commerce Review Aggregation**: Analyze product reviews to highlight top-rated items and detect low-rated products.
- **Customer Support Feedback**: Automatically flag negative responses for quick attention.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Track brand reputation by identifying positive vs. negative mentions.
- **Survey Analysis**: Summarize sentiment trends from large-scale customer feedback forms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-model.git
cd sentiment-analysis-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Loading the Model
Load the trained model in Python using:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model("sentiment_modelv1.1.keras")
```

### 3️⃣ Preparing Text Input
Embed raw text using the same sentence transformer model used during training. Example:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')

texts = [
    "I love this product! Highly recommended.",
    "This was a terrible experience."
]

embeddings = embedder.encode(texts, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=True)
```

### 4️⃣ Predicting Sentiment
Feed the embeddings to the sentiment model for prediction:

```python
import numpy as np

predictions = model.predict(embeddings)

for i, score in enumerate(predictions):
    label = "Positive" if score >= 0.5 else "Negative"
    print(f"Text: {texts[i]}\nSentiment: {label} (Confidence: {score[0]:.2f})\n")
```

---

## 📊 Performance
- **Accuracy**: 81.56% on the test dataset.
- **Model Size**: ~200KB (Keras HDF5 file).
- **Embedding Dimension**: 384 (from `all-mpnet-base-v2`).

---

## 📝 Notes
- The model supports **binary classification** (positive/negative).
- Neutral or mixed sentiments may be classified as positive due to the binary setup.
- Preprocess text (e.g., remove HTML tags) before embedding for best results.
